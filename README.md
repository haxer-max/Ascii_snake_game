This game is made in vanilla python (only numpy, but I'll migrate soon)

no GUI is used
it uses ascii characters for rendering.

## controls
'w' 'a' 's' 'd'

## how to run
open cmd(recommended) or powershell and run 
```
$ python snake.py
```


> This Windows only since linux users don't play game. Also linux doesn't have msvcrt library.
